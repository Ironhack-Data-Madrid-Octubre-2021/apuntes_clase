# Streamlit-Mola
Workshop to learn how to create a web application with streamlit to display our data analytics

In this repository you will find:

- A notebooks folder: with some supporting code that I have used to clean the data.

- A main.py: containing the streamlit code that we run to make the APP work locally.

- Manage data: a file with functions we need to manage the data before displaying it with streamlit.

## Remember!
Streamlit currently supports versions 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 of Python.


## You can...
- Create your own environment with conda or another method.
- Install yml (the environment I use and have exported)
